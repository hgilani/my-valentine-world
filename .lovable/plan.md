# 💕 Valentine's Day Websites

Two beautiful, soft & romantic Valentine's pages with pastel pinks, floating hearts, and gentle animations.

---

## Page 1: For Your Husband (`/husband`)
- **Hero section** with a large romantic photo of you two together
- Soft pink/rose gradient background with floating heart animations
- Beautiful message: **"Will You Be My Valentine?"** with a love note
- **Photo gallery** — a few cherished photos of you both displayed in cute heart-shaped or rounded frames
- **Interactive Yes/No buttons** — the "No" button playfully runs away when hovered, making "Yes" the only real option 😄
- When "Yes" is clicked → a burst of hearts animation with a sweet thank-you message

## Page 2: For Your Kids (`/kids`)
- **Hero section** with a family photo
- Same soft romantic aesthetic but slightly more playful/cute
- Beautiful message: **"You guys are my whole world 🌍 Will you be my Valentine?"**
- **Photo collage** — photos of you with the kids in adorable rounded frames with subtle animations
- **Same fun Yes/No interaction** — "No" runs away, "Yes" triggers a celebration with hearts and confetti
- Sweet message after clicking Yes

## Shared Design Elements
- Pastel pink, rose, and cream color palette
- Floating heart particles in the background
- Elegant cursive/script fonts for headings
- Smooth fade-in animations as you scroll
- Fully responsive — looks great on phones (since they'll probably open it on their phone!)
- A simple landing page (`/`) with two cute buttons: "For My Love" and "For My Babies" to navigate to each page

## Photos
- You'll upload your photos through the chat, and I'll place them beautifully on each page
